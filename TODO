- remove sexyicon code - I remember someone complaining that gedit was 
misusing this, so we shouldn't copy them!

  
Perhaps find a work around for the gtk sensitivity bug.
  Ideally I'd like to implement my original idea which is that buttons
  should disapear from the toolbar when they can't be pressed.

tidy up menus so they work
make sure the terminal always closes when gswat closes!
Perhaps add mouse over variable bubbles to display their value
 - also allow highlighting expressions
 - Consider not using bubbles though since they get in the way
   of code.

- put the side panes into gswat-notebooks
- test and fix the break/restart button and make sure we
  can use the new button at any time without things
  getting tangled.
- support clicking on frame entries within the stack view
  so that the source view gets updated appropriatly.

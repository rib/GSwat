todo
----

engineer a nicer object/interface model
- create a tabable interface
- enhance the source view class to implement the tabable interface
    - integrate code from gswat-tab.c into the source view as appropriate
- convert all my code to use my object/interface templates
 - still todo:
  - gswat-notebook.c
  - gswat-tab.c
- remove sexyicon code - I remember someone complaining that gedit was 
misusing this, so we shouldn't copy them!
  

fix rendering - on-going issue
tidy up menus so they work
make sure the terminal always closes when gswat closes!
Perhaps add mouse over variable bubbles to display their value
 - also allow highlighting expressions
 - Consider not using bubbles though since they get in the way
   of code.

- remove sexyicon code - I remember someone complaining that gedit was 
misusing this, so we shouldn't copy them!

  
- Perhaps find a work around for the gtk sensitivity bug.
  (Ref: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56070)
  - Ideally I'd like to implement my original idea which is that buttons
    should disapear from the toolbar when they can't be pressed.
    (special care taken e.g. for the "next" button so that we don't
     re-layout for every click)
- improve the menus
   - edit preferences is currently broken
   - implement help->about
- Perhaps add mouse over variable bubbles to display their value
 - also allow highlighting expressions
 - Consider not using bubbles though since they get in the way
   of code.
- test the interrupt button
- support clicking on frame entries within the stack view
  so that the source view gets updated appropriatly.
- try and seperate/abstract things so that the variable
  view and stack view work somewhat like mini plugins.
- implement socket based connections to a gswat-spwaner
- If I use the restart button while within main() then the local
  variables arn't being reset
- Ctrl-Q doesn't quit
- implement a text command based interface
  - commands should have long descriptive names
  - allow customisable aliases
    - by default provide aliases intuative to a gdb user
- the source view tab should not have a close button
  - currently the source view doesn't need a tab at all
- There are currently lots of io channel errors on exit where
  we try and delete variable objects after closing the gdb
  connection

engineer a nicer object/interface model
- convert all my code to use my object/interface templates
- remove sexyicon code - I remember someone complaining that gedit was 
misusing this, so we shouldn't copy them!
- change tab creation model:
   don't automatically open a new tab for each new file entered
   instead just use one tab for now. In the future add the concept
   of pinning a tab. I.e. once a tab is pinned then it displays
   a snapshot in time and further state changes are reflected by
   opening a new tab.
  
Perhaps find a work around for the gtk sensitive bug.
  Ideally I'd like to implement my original idea which is that buttons
  should disapear from the toolbar when they can't be pressed.

tidy up menus so they work
make sure the terminal always closes when gswat closes!
Perhaps add mouse over variable bubbles to display their value
 - also allow highlighting expressions
 - Consider not using bubbles though since they get in the way
   of code.

- remove sexyicon code - I remember someone complaining that gedit was 
misusing this, so we shouldn't copy them!

  
- Perhaps find a work around for the gtk sensitivity bug.
  (Ref: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56070)
  - Ideally I'd like to implement my original idea which is that buttons
    should disapear from the toolbar when they can't be pressed.
    (special care taken e.g. for the "next" button so that we don't
     re-layout for every click)
- improve the menus
   - edit preferences is currently broken
   - implement help->about
- make sure the terminal always closes when gswat closes!
- Perhaps add mouse over variable bubbles to display their value
 - also allow highlighting expressions
 - Consider not using bubbles though since they get in the way
   of code.
- test and fix the break/restart button and make sure we
  can use the new button at any time without things
  getting tangled.
- support clicking on frame entries within the stack view
  so that the source view gets updated appropriatly.
- try and seperate/abstract things so that the variable
  view and stack view work somewhat like mini plugins.
- When a debuggable sends a state = detached notification
  then we should blank the source view and other widgets
  to reflect this.
- I dont think the source view should wrap text by default
- gswat-spawner processes are regularly being left clogging
  the system.
- implement socket based connections to a gswat-spwaner
